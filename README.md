# Sentiment-Analysis-Model
First project from Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Program

# About this repository
This repository is the resolution of the first project of the udacity machine learning program. The objective of this project was to analyze a set of texts from movie reviews and create a Machine Learning model that classifies this text as negative or positive review.

In addition, this project also consisted of a deploy of the implemented model, which can be seen in the [index.html](https://github.com/LMicol/Sentiment-Analysis-Model/blob/master/index.html), in this file the user could type his review that was sent to the AWS server and processed by the endpoint hosted there.

Feel free to view my complete resolution in the [SageMaker Project.ipynb](https://github.com/LMicol/Sentiment-Analysis-Model/blob/master/SageMaker%20Project.ipynb) file
